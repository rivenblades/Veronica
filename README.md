This will be a tool to have all my code that i have written to one place online and offline, and when i need something, let's say a camera.h file, i wont search all my projects for what camera.h's i have used but look directly into the unified codebase(Veronica®) and link it there.


To accomplish that, i would need a tool to link these files and projects to my new project that needs them(link the camera.h file to my current project) and keep track of changes

e.g pip like
